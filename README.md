# UpFallAmmoUsingRaysToCheckNeighbors
Yet another version of my falling block game.  This time, instead of using a two dimensional array to keep track of block location I will use a ray shot from the center of a block that collides to through the for midpoints of each block edge for a length of the width of a block.  I should be able to determine if there is an objects that the ray intersects.
